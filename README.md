This is a matlab GUI that allows user to transform any picture into a cross-stitch pattern.
You can also define a blank grid and use a pen tool to edit or draw a picture.

The pen uses colors that are a subset of DMC colors, DMC is a brand of cross-stitch thread and they sell only certain 
colors. The GUI can convert all pixles into the least-squares nearest DMC color (based on R-G-B). 

Saving an edited or new picture saves the picture with a grid in high resolution.
